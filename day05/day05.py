'''Day 05 of Advent of Code 2020

The prompt is that you're given a list a boarding passes to process.
Boarding passes are formatted as follows:
    BFFFBBFRRR: row 70, column 7, seat ID 567

    Where the B and F determine which half of the current rows to search in.
    L and R determine which half (left or right) of the columns to search in.

    Replace B and R with 1, and F and L with 0 and it looks like two 0b numbers.
    The above becomes 1000110111
                      \     /\ /
