# Advent of Code 2020

---

## Code Organization
Witin the repo, there is a directory for each day of the advent calendar.

day01 has day01.py and day01_input.txt, day02 is structured similarly and so on.

On days where the puzzle is more difficult, there will be test files as well.

---

## How To

### Get Started Each Day
Create the boilerplate for day D by running the following command:
```
python3 new_day.py -d=D
```
This creates a directory day02, and files day02.py and day02_input.txt per the code organization section.

### Produce a Solution
Run the code with the input file to produce the solution(s) for day D as follows:
```
python3 day0D.py -f=day0D_input.txt 
```

In the case of day 1, my (your input would be different) full result would be:
```
$ python3 day01.py -f=day01_input.txt 
Day 01 solution: 73371
```
