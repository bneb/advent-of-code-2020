## Code Organization
Witin the repo, there is a directory for each day of the advent calendar.

- Day 1 has directory `day01` containing `day01.py` and `day01_input.txt`.
- Day 2 is structured similarly and so on for the rest of the days.

On days where the puzzle is more difficult, there will be test files as well.

## How To

### Get Started Each Day
Create the boilerplate for day D by running the following command:
```
python3 new_day.py -d=D
```
This creates a directory `day0D`, and files `day0D.py` and `day0D_input.txt` per the code organization section.

### Produce a Solution
Run the code with the input file to produce the solution(s) for day D as follows:
```
python3 day0D.py -f=day0D_input.txt 
```

In the case of day 1, my result for part 1 would look like:
```
$ python3 day01.py -f=day01_input.txt 
Day 01 solution: 73371
```
